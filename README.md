# COMP 3612, Fall 2023
### Assessment for Lab #4 on Chapter 9

I will mark Chapter 9, Project 2 in textbook, pages 475-477. I have also provided a PDF of those pages.

I have provided the starting files here.

I will mark this in the Nov 7 or 14 tutorial. You will need to learn this material for the second assignment due on Nov 20, so I would very strongly encourage you to finish this lab in the week of Nov 6-10.
